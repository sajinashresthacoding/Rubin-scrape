# Rubin-Scrape. (ONGOING)
## Project by Sajina Shrestha 

##  Synopsis: 
#### This is a project on finding data on the Tibetan cultural objects in the online collection of The Rubin Museum.

## Context: 
#### Repatriation is a state-to-state affair with a country returning stolen pieces/art/artefacts/cultural objects back to the origin country. But, what does repatriation or an attempt at repatriation look like if one of the countries is not recognized as a sovereign state? This project is taking a look at the current condition of Tibetan cultural objects, seeing where they are located, how they are collected, and what the process of return looks like. 

## Methodoloy:
#### I picked the Rubin Museum because they hold a large amount of Tibetan cultural objects and are usually known for their collection of Himalayan Art. I looked into their collection just to see how the Tibetan cultural objects were characterized and put on display. This will help inform where I need to look and what questions I need to be asking. 

## Caveats:
#### The online collection is not the same as their actual collection that is not digitized. Mention this in the reporting. 

## Skills used: 
#### Scraping, Spot-checking, Pandas, Conditional Statements etc.
